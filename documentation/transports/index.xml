      <description>Local Mutagen&amp;rsquo;s most basic transport provides support for synchronizing with local filesystem locations.
Usage Local filesystem endpoints can be specified to Mutagen&amp;rsquo;s create command using their local path in either an absolute or relative format. If a relative path is specified, then it will be resolved relative to the working directory in which the create command is issued before being used to create the session.</description>

      <description>SSH Mutagen provides support for synchronizing with filesystem locations accessible via SSH. This support extends to SSH clients and servers found on both POSIX and Windows systems.
Requirements Mutagen requires an OpenSSH client installation to be available on your system. This is the default for almost all POSIX operating systems, so you probably don&amp;rsquo;t need to do anything if you&amp;rsquo;re on macOS, Linux®, or one of the BSDs. Windows is supported as well, but please see the section on Windows support for more detailed information.</description>

      <title>Support for Docker® containers</title>
      <link>https://mutagen.io/documentation/transports/docker/</link>

      <description>Support for Docker® containers Mutagen has support for synchronizing with filesystems inside Docker® containers. This support extends to all Docker client platforms (Linux®, macOS, Windows, etc.), Docker daemon setups (local, remote, VM, Hyper-V, etc.), and Docker container types (both Linux and Windows containers are supported).
NOTE: Mutagen&amp;rsquo;s support for Docker containers is considered &amp;ldquo;experimental&amp;rdquo; in the sense that it is new (less mature than SSH support), minimalist, and designed for experimentation.</description>
